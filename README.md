# Free Diving into Food Facts

# Abstract
While everybody buys and consumes numerous food-related products every day, little care is given in the precise products’ compositions.   
For the sake of this study, we decided to focus our effort on the [Open Food Facts database](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data) regrouping the information of a very broad variety of products, including their nutrition facts and derived nutrition scores from different standards, such as the [UK Food Standards Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Standards_Agency)'s (FSA) or the same score but derived from the French market. 

We will focus on the analysis of the predominant products over the world. Several directions will be explored such as the nutritional differences between regular and bio-products, the differences across countries, the effect of ingredients on selected nutrition scores.
We will try to provide appealing and interactive visualizations to support our findings and analysis.


# Research questions

* Comparing bio vs. normal products, is there a real difference in composition?
* What are the levels of interdependencies between nations based on their production and importations? 
* Among the largest food companies, which ones have the broadest portfolio? In which sectors are they predominant?
* How do ingredients or categories influence the selected nutrition scores? 

# Dataset
* Lettuce analyse this dataset: [Open Food Fact database](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data)

#### Optional
* [Dunnhumby dataset](https://www.dunnhumby.com/careers/engineering/sourcefiles)

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
##### 28th to 3rd of November:
* Setup git structure, coding conventions, and select tools/libraries
* Explore data, explore what’s available
* Play with the dataset
##### 4th to 10th of November:
* Assess data cleanliness, missing data proportion, data distribution across countries and categories
* Data preprocessing
* Data cleaning
##### 11th to 17th of November: 
* Preliminary assesment of questions
* Investigation of possible visualizations/plots
* Refinement/selection of kept research questions
#####  18th to 25th of November:
* Selection of plots / visualizations
* Cleaning, proof-reading
* Plan upcoming objectives

# Questions for TAs
* In what extent are we supposed to spread our analysis, meaning should we focus on a single topic and dive deep or should we cover multiple topics superficially?
* The dataset is highly unbalanced between countries, are we allowed to focus the analysis on the most represented countries?
* Are there some other datasets related to openfoodfacts where we can obtain information about food consumption for each countrys? Could we (maybe) use the dunnhumby dataset?
