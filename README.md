# Free Diving into Food Facts

# Abstract
While everybody buys and consumes numerous food-related products every day, little care is given in the precise productsâ€™ compositions.   
For the sake of this study, we decided to focus our effort on the [Open Food Facts database](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data) regrouping the information of a very broad variety of products, including their nutrition facts and derived nutrition scores from different standards, such as the [UK Food Standards Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Standards_Agency)'s (FSA) or the same score but derived from the French market. 

We will concentrate on the quantitative comparison of bio vs normal products. In particular, we will explore different views to compare these two categories. We will assess whether the general common knowledge that bio products are healthier than normal products is true. We will provide an appealing data story to guide you through our analysis.

# Research questions
* Comparing **bio vs. normal products**, is there a real difference between them? In particular, we will focus our analysis on the following main questions:
  * Is there a difference of nutrition score between these two categories ?
  * Are there any differences in terms of additives ?
  * What about their [Nova score](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOVA_(nutrition)) ?
  * And their composition ?

# Dataset
* Lettuce analyse this dataset: [Open Food Fact database](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data).  
The dataset is built as part of a collaborative project to build a free and open database of alimentary items commercially available worldwide. It is stored as a `.csv` file containing several fields (not always indicated), typically the list of ingredients of the product, the nutritional table (usually indicated on the back of the product), nutritional scores, the brand and distributor, the packaging of the product, and more.

#### Optional
* [Ciqual dataset](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/table-de-composition-nutritionnelle-des-aliments-ciqual/) which contains a table of nutritional composition for various food products, in particular **raw** products (fruits and vegetables).
